#### Integrations

##### Datadog Cloud SIEM V2

-   Updated the Docker image to: _demisto/datadog-api-client:1.0.0.4893383_.

-   Updated the **Datadog Cloud SIEM V2** integration to focus exclusively on Cloud SIEM functionality. The integration now correctly maps **Datadog Cloud SIEM V2 Security Signals** to XSOAR incidents instead of Datadog Incident Management incidents, aligning with proper SIEM integration patterns. **Note:** This is a breaking change - users of version 1.x must reconfigure the integration to use security signals instead of incidents and update any playbooks or automations that depend on removed commands.
-   Deprecated the following commands to maintain product focus on Cloud SIEM:
    -   **_datadog-event-create_** and **_datadog-event-list_** (Events API)
    -   **_datadog-tag-list_**, **_datadog-host-tag-create_**, **_datadog-host-tag-get_**, **_datadog-host-tag-update_**, and **_datadog-host-tag-delete_** (Tags/Hosts API)
    -   **_datadog-active-metric-list_**, **_datadog-metric-search_**, **_datadog-metric-metadata-get_**, **_datadog-metric-metadata-update_**, and **_datadog-time-series-point-query_** (Metrics API)
    -   **_datadog-incident-create_**, **_datadog-incident-delete_**, **_datadog-incident-update_**, and **_datadog-incident-list_** (Incident Management API)
-   Added support for **Security Signals API** with full CRUD operations through the following commands:
    -   **_datadog-signal-get_** - Retrieve a specific security signal by ID
    -   **_datadog-signal-list_** - List and filter security signals with advanced query support
    -   **_datadog-signal-update_** - Update security signal _assignee_ and _triage state_ (open, under_review, archived)
    -   **_datadog-signal-comment-add_** - Add comments to security signals for collaboration and documentation
    -   **_datadog-signal-comment-list_** - List all comments on a security signal
-   Added support for **Security Rules API** through the following commands:
    -   **_datadog-rule-get_** - Retrieve detailed information about a specific security rule
    -   **_datadog-rule-suppress_** - Suppress a security rule with optional data exclusion queries
    -   **_datadog-rule-unsuppress_** - Remove suppression from a security rule
-   Added the **_datadog-logs-query_** command for security investigations and threat hunting.
-   You can now automatically fetch security signals as XSOAR incidents with configurable filters including _severity_ (info, low, medium, high, critical), _state_ (open, under_review, archived), custom query filters using Datadog search syntax, automatic severity mapping to XSOAR severity levels, and configurable fetch time range and limits.
-   Improved implementation with modern dataclass architecture for type safety and maintainability, comprehensive context outputs for all security signal fields (_triage state_, _assignee_, _rule details_), support for Datadog's native search syntax in query parameters, pagination support with configurable limits, enhanced error handling and validation, and full support for security signal triage workflows.
-   Updated the documentation with detailed command examples and use cases, comprehensive context output documentation, troubleshooting section for common issues, and Cloud SIEM-specific configuration guide.
